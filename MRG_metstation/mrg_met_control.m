function mrg_met_control(verbosity)
% The core Metstation control file
%
% This function opens a serial connection and generates an infinite loop
% that reads incomming data and processes it as required.
%
% INPUT
%   verbosity   An integer specifying the level of output to the console.
%               This only effects output to screen and has no effect on 
%               the logging to file.
%               0 = No output
%               1 = Minimal output (The default)
%               2 = Outputs every time a string is read
%               3 = Also reports the size of data in the buffer
%
% OUTPUT
%   This function reports information to the console and to a file named:
%       met_log_yyyy_mmm.txt
%   Where yyyy and mmm are the year and abbreviated month name, repectivly.
%   Other heavy lifting is done by mrg_met_output and further details can
%   be found there.
%
% REQUIREMENTS
%   Requires mrg_met_test_string and mrg_met_output
